# Fixable

**Fixable** is a deliberately insecure web application built with Spring Boot and React. It was developed for educational purposes as part of the *Tarponise* initiative at the University of Pernambuco, aiming to provide a hands-on learning environment for pentesting, secure software development and vulnerability mitigation.

## 📚 Purpose

Rather than simply identifying vulnerabilities, Fixable encourages learners to understand, fix, and track their progress as they secure a real application. The core idea is that progress is not defined by how many flaws are found, but by how many are properly fixed.

## 🔍 Focus Areas

Fixable simulates common mistakes made in modern web applications, particularly those related to the OWASP top 10. However, it is not complete and more categories will be added progressively to reflect real-world scenarios and emerging security issues.

## 🚀 Target Audience

This application is intended for:

- University students studying secure development or AppSec
- Developers transitioning into security-focused roles
- Educators looking for a practical tool to teach security concepts

## 🛠️ How It Works

Fixable is meant to be cloned and run locally. It mimics a production-like environment where students can explore, exploit, and correct vulnerabilities within the application’s flow.

## 🔒 Project Philosophy

> *"We don't gamify breaking — we gamify remediation."*

Unlike traditional intentionally vulnerable applications like Juice Shop or WebGoat, Fixable emphasizes the secure coding journey: understanding the flaw, reproducing it, fixing it, and verifying the fix.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Java + Spring Boot
- **Frontend:** React (with Tailwind CSS)
- **Database:** H2 (so far)

## 🤝 Attribution

Created under the Tarponise extension project – a cybersecurity education program from the University of Pernambuco (UPE).

**Note:** This application is not intended to be deployed to production environments. It is insecure by design.
